                <p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.mmu.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU)</a> in 2019 with a BSc.</p>
                <p>For several years I wanted to work in the IT sector, particularly programming. I studied ICT after finishing school and then went on to study Computer Games Technology while at university. The course involved designing video games using well-known engines such as Unity and Unreal as well as learning C++ and website design.</p>

                <p>During my time at university I took part in <a href="https://www.campamerica.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Camp America</a>. I enjoyed being a camp counsellor, teaching programming to children and taking part in other fun activities. I lived with a host family just outside of Washington D.C. I worked at the same camp for two summers in 2017 and 2018. I received excellent feedback from parents and staff in both my summers there.</p>

                <p>After enjoying this, I decided to pursue a career in teaching and got my first job as a supply practitioner within an early years setting. I have worked hard to acheive numerous qualifications including a Level 6 Early Years Teacher qualification.</p>
                <p>For a short period I had my own childcare business working from home, delivering high quality teaching, liaising with external agencies, social media promotion and talking to new parents as well as existing ones.</p>
                <p>Over the last few years, I've spent many hours of my personal time in the evenings and/or weekends working on projects. These projects have been tested and used by more than 100 individual users. These can be provided if requested.</p>
